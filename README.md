Over the last couple of decades, music has become an integral part of people's routines across the world. Irrespective of the language barrier, listening to music is considered a part of people's life especially while driving, cooking, at the gym, or at times during work for relaxation. Since every human is different, the choice of music varies from person to person and depends on an individual’s activity, age, and state of mind. Thus, it is critical to identify the selected song's genre so that the next few songs can be suggested based on the selected song. Therefore, developing an algorithm that can accurately classify the songs into different genres is imperative. This research uses Spotify data from Kaggle to perform an analysis and examine the accuracy of unsupervised and supervised machine learning models in making predictions. The process of dimensionality reduction of data using PCA is described in the study. K-means clustering is used to classify the genre of the songs, and hierarchical clustering techniques are used to enhance and identify the subgenre of the songs. K-Means has performed with an accuracy of 65%. Two supervised machine learning were developed to classify the songs into different genres, where the Logistic regression predicted with an accuracy of 77% and the random forest model predicted with an accuracy of 83% on the test data
